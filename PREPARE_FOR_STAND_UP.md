# How to Prepare for TA Stand Up

This document outlines the process for preparing for weekly TA standup meetings to ensure effective communication and accountability.

## Overview

The TA standup preparation process ensures that all team members contribute to status updates and that the team presents a coordinated view of their progress, challenges, and needs.

## Preparation Process

### Step 1: Individual Retrospective Updates
**Timeline: Before team standup preparation meeting**

1. **Each team member** must update the current week's retrospective document with their individual contributions
2. **Required sections to complete:**
   - Individual Self-Assessment for your assigned team member section
   - Achievements and Contributions
   - Challenges Faced
   - Areas for Improvement
   - Feedback and Suggestions
3. **Commit your changes** to the repository before the team meeting
4. **Use descriptive commit messages** (e.g., "Add John's week 5 retrospective update")

### Step 2: Team Standup Preparation Meeting
**Timeline: Before TA standup (typically 1-2 days prior)**

#### Meeting Agenda:
1. **Review Individual Updates (15 minutes)**
   - Each member briefly presents their retrospective contributions
   - Discuss any significant achievements or blockers
   - Identify common themes or issues

2. **Determine Team Status (20 minutes)**
   - Consolidate individual progress into overall team status
   - Assess project timeline and deliverable progress
   - Review external partner feedback and requirements

3. **Identify Action Items and Escalations (15 minutes)**
   - Determine if there are any action items for the upcoming week
   - Identify issues that need to be escalated to the TA
   - Assign responsibility for follow-up actions

4. **Prepare Shared Talking Points (10 minutes)**
   - Agree on key messages for the TA standup
   - Designate who will present each topic
   - Prepare any questions or requests for TA guidance

### Step 3: TA Standup Execution
**Timeline: During scheduled TA standup**

1. **Producer or Team Lead** presents consolidated team status
2. **Share key achievements** from the week
3. **Present challenges** and blockers
4. **Request TA guidance** on escalated issues
5. **Confirm action items** and next steps

## Accountability and Transparency

### Commit Tracking
- **TA and Professor visibility:** All retrospective commits are visible to teaching staff
- **Individual accountability:** Each team member's contributions are tracked through git history
- **Participation verification:** Commit history demonstrates active participation in the reflection process

### Quality Standards
- **Meaningful updates:** Retrospective entries should be substantive and reflective
- **Honest assessment:** Include both successes and challenges
- **Actionable insights:** Focus on learnings that can improve future performance

## Best Practices

### For Individual Updates:
- **Be specific:** Include concrete examples of work completed
- **Be honest:** Acknowledge challenges and areas for improvement
- **Be constructive:** Suggest solutions or next steps
- **Be timely:** Complete updates before the team meeting

### For Team Meetings:
- **Come prepared:** Review others' updates before the meeting
- **Be collaborative:** Help identify solutions to shared challenges
- **Be decisive:** Make clear decisions about escalations and action items
- **Be organized:** Keep notes and follow up on commitments

### For TA Standups:
- **Be concise:** Respect time constraints
- **Be prepared:** Have specific questions and requests ready
- **Be engaged:** Listen actively to TA feedback and guidance
- **Be responsive:** Follow up on TA recommendations promptly

## Template Checklist

Before each TA standup, ensure:

- [ ] All team members have committed their retrospective updates
- [ ] Team has met to discuss consolidated status
- [ ] Action items for the week have been identified
- [ ] Issues requiring TA escalation have been documented
- [ ] Team spokesperson is prepared with talking points
- [ ] Any questions for the TA have been formulated
- [ ] Next week's priorities have been discussed

## Troubleshooting

### If a team member hasn't committed their update:
1. Reach out immediately via team communication channel
2. Offer to help if they're facing technical difficulties
3. If persistent, escalate to TA during standup

### If the team can't meet before standup:
1. Conduct a brief virtual check-in (15-20 minutes minimum)
2. Use asynchronous communication to align on key messages
3. Designate one person to consolidate updates and present

### If there are conflicting views on team status:
1. Focus on objective metrics and deliverables
2. Acknowledge different perspectives openly
3. Escalate disagreements to TA for guidance
